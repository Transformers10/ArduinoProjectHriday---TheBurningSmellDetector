I decided to use the 320*C for 150 milliseconds heat packet in my Arduino Code after testing. During Training, the gas resistance dropped and the temperature
rose due to the properties of the burning smell detected. Humidity did not really change as well as pressure. IF statements were then created for the temperature 
and gas resistance.
